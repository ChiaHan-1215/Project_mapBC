## Goal: Project for retrive region from bladder cancer GWAS marker in HPRC/CARD dataset

## Data:

- phased fastqs
    - HPRC: in Biowulf `/fdb/HPRC/r2/`
    - CARD: in Mila's biowulf folder

- Aligned BAMs
  - The current HPRC/CARD BAM are located in T-drive: `/Volumes/ifs/DCEG/Branches/LTG/Prokunina/HPRC and CARD genes regions/Assemblies_regional_Analysis_bladder_and_other_hg38`

## Code: 

`Retrive_region.md` How to retrive region from HPRC/CARD`


 THe current working dic is in my Biowulf, will update later `/data/leec20/GWAS_COVNET_related`
